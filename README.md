# Shapez Theme for Hugo
Designed with passion and love.
Shapez is a modern hugo theme using a lot of SVG graphics.
SVG is super cool, but be aware - it can also be very nasty and exhausting.

# What it's meant to be
Initially I designed this theme for my own blog, but I decided to make it an open source project, because I thought other people might like it, too.
If you want to use it feel free to do so, but be prepared to learn some SVG if you want to adapt the theme to your wishes.
